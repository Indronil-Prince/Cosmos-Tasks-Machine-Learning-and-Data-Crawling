COSMOS TASK - MACHINE LEARNING AND VISUALIZATION

Hello. It is Indronil Bhattacharjee. I have tried to attempt the task to apply machine learning algorithm and visualization through treemap to an app. 

1) Here flask_app.py is the codes for the desired app.
2) index.html under the folder templates is the template which is being rendered here.
3) This is just a simple site for visualization and you can find find it in http://indronil.pythonanywhere.com/ too.

Thank you.
